Authentication: Verify you are who you say you are

Authorization: Are you allowed to do the thing you are trying to do

## Task
When a user visits my web app have they been here before? if so, are they allowed to do the thing they are trying to do otherwise, redirect them to the login

Does the schema need to change?
What routes do i need?
"/current_user"
"/auth/"
