# Higher Order Components

A pattern for us to share behavior between Components
DRY

- We'll see this in some libraries, HOC `withRouter`, Redux `connect`
- Authentication, withAuth

Higher Order Functions
`map`, `filter` fns which take other fns as arguments
components (which are just functions) it will take another component as an argument
