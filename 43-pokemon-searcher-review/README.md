# React Pokemon Searcher

## React Code Challenge Practice

## Project goals:
  <!-- - create an index displaying pokemon 'cards' -->
    <!-- - render each pokemon name, picture, and hp in a card -->
    <!-- - when clicked, the card should toggle between displaying the front and back pictures -->
  
  <!-- - allow users to search in order to narrow down the cards shown on the page -->
  
  - wire up the form to add a missing pokemon (bulbasaur is missing, and you can probably intuit the image links to use based on the data you have). Since there aren't any validations, you may have to manually remove additions from the db.json file if you make a mistake on a post request, etc. When a new pokemon is added, it should show on the page without having to refresh.
  - BONUS: implement some way to sort or filter pokemon in addition to the name search

## Project requirements:
  - components using state and props
  - re-renders based on client-side events
  - can both get data from, and post data to the json server/database


## Trying to figure out where to start?

  For the most part, the framework for this application is already made, with a simple json server, and a react app, with all the components needed. When you run `npm start` a json server will spin up and you can access the pokemon info at http://localhost:3000/pokemon, and your react application will also start, on port 3001. Given a list of deliverables, our goal is to navigate the existing code base and implement several new features. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the structure of the application, and think about where you will be making changes in order to implement the new features. While you could solve this lab without creating new components, or changing any existing ones to be functional components, you are encouraged to do so if it makes sense to do that at any point.

  Be sure to use good programming practices, such as clear variable names and single responsibility functions. We want our react app to be clean, easy to read and understand, and of course, easy to to debug, or even add more features to later.

## Styling
  We've imported the Semantic library to keep your pokemon looking pretty. It may be helpful to take a look at the [Semantic Docs](https://react.semantic-ui.com), particularly when working with the [Search component](https://react.semantic-ui.com/views/search), to see how the props are passed into it, and how it wires up a function to be called onSearchChange when someone starts typing into it. There are a lot of extra props that can be passed to the component that makes it look messy and intimidating if you aren't familiar - not to worry! We have supplied the only 2 you need. Just go about making the onSearchChange prop work - it will need a handler. If you aren't familiar with [debounce](https://lodash.com/docs#debounce), which is also already set up, that's ok. All it does is prevent the method inside it from firing every single time there's a change in the search input. It enforces a delay so the user gets a chance to type a bit before the results instantly change, and stops your application from having to do too many rapid-fire searches on every key-press. In this context, all you really care about is that the right function is defined in the first place for handling when that input changes, and you can put it right into the debounce instead of the console log we placed there. Again - the Semantic UI docs are helpful for seeing a working example of that.
